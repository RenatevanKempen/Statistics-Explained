# Statistics-Explained
In this repository I will put concepts and information, clearly explained, to help anyone that wants to get better in Statistics

- I'll show you Python codes to help you make calculations
- The book from Ott & Longnecker only provides R-codes, I've changed these into Python codes for all Python experts
- I'll show you how to use LaTex to make the proper formulas in Python
- All scripts have comments in it, but please feel free to contact me (renate@baime.nl) if something is not clear enough!!
- I've also added a summary of the book from Ott & Longnecker, so you have all definitions in one (fairly smaller) word document. 

Hope this repository helps you in getting better at statistics. 
Let me know what you think. 

Kind regards, 
Renate van Kempen
